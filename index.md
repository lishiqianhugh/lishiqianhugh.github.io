# Projects

### Research on adversarial perturbation on large-scale point cloud	
#### _2020/12-2021/03_
* I was an intern under the supervision of Dr. Jiwen-Lu, Tsinghua University, responsible for the work in semantic segmentation task. 
* We proposed a general end-to-end framework of learning adversarial pertrubation for 3D object detection and semantic segmentation. We designed a novel pumping loss to accelerate the attacking process and improve the attacking perfomance.

### Research on facial expression recognition based on NAS	
#### _2020/05-2020/07_
* Supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China.
* We initially applied NAS to facial expression recognition, achieving improvement both in accuracy and model size and outperforming many state-of-the-art methods.

### Research on propaganda detection in news articles	
#### _2019/10-2019/12_
* I was responsible for data preprocessing and paper writing. Rank 19th globally in SemEval 2020.
* We fine-tuned an advanced model to locate propaganda fractions and classified them in news articles, using data augmentation and semantic fusion technique.
